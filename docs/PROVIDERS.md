# Provider Configuration

Each inference has its own environment variables. You can include all of these in an env file and pass it to your container. Use [default-values.env](./env/default-values.env) as a template, and copy it to `values.env` for local edits.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These are `.env` values, so avoid wrapping values in quotes unless required by the provider.
>
> `VLLM_API_KEY=token` (recommended)
>
> `VLLM_API_KEY="token"` (can cause parsing issues)
> 
> You will notice the `api_key_env` field is not wrapped in curly-braces `{}`. This is due to Lightspeed Core wrapping them internally to curate a proper `{env.xyz}` to pass through to Llama Stack so the keys are not exposed internally.

> [!NOTE]
> Commented provider stubs for `vllm`, `openai`, and `vertexai` live under `inference.providers` in [lightspeed-stack.yaml](../lightspeed-core-configs/lightspeed-stack.yaml). The `byo-llm` baseline means these stay at that top-level section — do not add them to `llama_stack.config.native_override`. For local development, copy that file to `lightspeed-core-configs/lightspeed-stack.local.yaml` (gitignored, auto-mounted by `make local-up` when present — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)), uncomment the block(s) you need, and set the required env vars.
>
> For GitOps/production, [scripts/generate-gitops-manifests.sh](../scripts/generate-gitops-manifests.sh) uncomments those three providers, then adds production `allowed_models` for `openai` and `vertexai`.

## vLLM

To add the `vLLM` inference provider, uncomment the corresponding block in [lightspeed-stack.yaml](../lightspeed-core-configs/lightspeed-stack.yaml) (via `lightspeed-core-configs/lightspeed-stack.local.yaml` for local development). The stub looks like:

```yaml
inference:
  providers:
    - type: vllm
      id: <your-unique-id>
      api_key_env: VLLM_API_KEY
      extra:
        base_url: ${env.VLLM_URL:=}
        max_tokens: ${env.VLLM_MAX_TOKENS:=4096}
        network:
          tls:
            verify: ${env.VLLM_TLS_VERIFY:=true}
```

In order for `vLLM` to configure properly, you must include environment variables named `VLLM_API_KEY` and `VLLM_URL` to the Lightspeed Core container.

## OpenAI

To add the `openai` inference provider, uncomment the corresponding block in [lightspeed-stack.yaml](../lightspeed-core-configs/lightspeed-stack.yaml) (via `lightspeed-core-configs/lightspeed-stack.local.yaml` for local development). The stub looks like:

```yaml
inference:
  providers:
    - type: openai
      id: <your-unique-id>
      api_key_env: OPENAI_API_KEY
```

You must pass the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` to the Lightspeed Core container.

Get your API key from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys).

## Vertex AI (Gemini)

To add the `vertexai` inference provider, uncomment the corresponding block in [lightspeed-stack.yaml](../lightspeed-core-configs/lightspeed-stack.yaml) (via `lightspeed-core-configs/lightspeed-stack.local.yaml` for local development). The stub looks like:

```yaml
inference:
  providers:
    - type: vertexai
      id: <your-unique-id>
      extra:
        project: ${env.VERTEX_AI_PROJECT:=}
        location: ${env.VERTEX_AI_LOCATION:=global}
```

Additionally, you need to ensure your Google Application Credentials are mounted to the Lightspeed Core container and the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable is the path to the mount location.

To set this up with the provided `compose/compose.yaml`, set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_HOST_PATH` to the path on your host machine of a GCP service account JSON key (or your `gcloud auth application-default login` credentials file). The compose file mounts that file into the container and points `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` at the mounted path for you — do not set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to a host path yourself, since that path won't exist inside the container.

```env
VERTEX_AI_PROJECT=
VERTEX_AI_LOCATION=
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_HOST_PATH=<path-on-your-host-to-a-gcp-service-account-json-key>
```

The service account (or `gcloud auth application-default login` credentials) needs the `Vertex AI User` role, and the Vertex AI API must be enabled on `VERTEX_AI_PROJECT`.

Provider details: [Llama Stack (OGX) Vertex AI docs](https://ogx-ai.github.io/docs/providers/inference/remote_vertexai).

For GitOps/production, [generate-gitops-manifests.sh](../scripts/generate-gitops-manifests.sh) uncomments this stub and adds `allowed_models`. If the production shape changes, update the tracked stub and/or `add_inference_allowed_models` in that script.

## Restricting Models (`allowed_models`)

Each of the providers above supports an `allowed_models` field to limit which models get registered with Llama Stack. This is most useful for `openai` and `vertexai`, since they auto-discover every model available to your account/project unless restricted.

To use it locally, add `allowed_models` under the provider's `extra` block in `lightspeed-core-configs/lightspeed-stack.local.yaml`. For GitOps/production, [generate-gitops-manifests.sh](../scripts/generate-gitops-manifests.sh) overlays production `allowed_models` automatically for `openai` and `vertexai`.

Open AI example:
```yaml
inference:
  providers:
    - type: openai
      id: <your-unique-id>
      api_key_env: OPENAI_API_KEY
      extra:
        allowed_models:
          - gpt-4o
          - gpt-4o-mini
```

If `allowed_models` is omitted, all models the provider can see are registered.
